# Step 4 Resentment Inventory

This directory contains your personal resentment inventory as part of Step 4: "Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves."

## The Four Column Inventory Process

Based on the Big Book (pages 64-67), the resentment inventory follows this structure:

### Column 1: I'm resentful at
List the person, institution, or principle you resent.

### Column 2: The Cause
What did they do? Be specific about the incident or behavior.

### Column 3: Affects my
Check which areas of your life this affects:
- **Self-esteem**: How I think of myself
- **Security**: Emotional and economic security
- **Ambitions**: My goals and desires
- **Personal relations**: Relationships with others
- **Sex relations**: Intimate relationships
- **Pride**: How I think others view me
- **Pocketbook**: Financial security

### Column 4: Where was I at fault?
After completing the first three columns for all resentments, look at each one and ask:
- Was I **selfish**?
- Was I **self-seeking**?
- Was I **dishonest**?
- Was I **frightened**?
- Was I **inconsiderate**?

## Using This System

1. **Create your inventory**: Copy `example-resentment.json` to start your own inventory
2. **Be thorough**: List everyone and everything you resent, no matter how small
3. **Be honest**: This is between you and your Higher Power
4. **Look for patterns**: Notice recurring character defects in Column 4
5. **Pray for them**: Use the prayer from page 552 for each person you resent

## The Resentment Prayer (Page 552)

"This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done."

Or create your own prayer asking that the person have everything you want for yourself.

## Remember

"Resentment is the 'number one' offender. It destroys more alcoholics than anything else." (Big Book, page 64)

The goal is not to justify your resentments but to see your part and find freedom from them.
