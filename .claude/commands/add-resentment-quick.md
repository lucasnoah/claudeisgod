Quick add a resentment with minimal prompting. Provide all information at once:

Format your response like this:
```
Person: [who you're resentful at]
Cause: [what they did]
Affects: [list areas affected: self-esteem, security, ambitions, personal-relations, sex-relations, pride, pocketbook]
My part: [list your defects: selfish, self-seeking, dishonest, frightened, inconsiderate]
Description: [describe your part in detail]
```

Example:
```
Person: My boss
Cause: Passed me over for promotion
Affects: self-esteem, security, ambitions, pride
My part: selfish, self-seeking, frightened
Description: I was selfish wanting the promotion only for status. Self-seeking in putting my desires first. Frightened of being seen as a failure.
```

I'll add this to your resentment inventory with proper validation.
