Update an existing resentment in your inventory. 

First, tell me which resentment you want to update by providing either:
- The person/institution name
- The resentment ID

Then specify what you want to update:

**Add a realization:**
`add realization: [your new insight about this resentment]`

**Add an action taken:**
`add action: [action you took] | outcome: [what happened]`

**Update prayer status:**
`prayer: yes/no | notes: [any prayer notes]`

**Update amends status:**
`amends: not_needed / to_be_made / in_progress / completed / living_amends`

**Mark as resolved:**
`resolved: yes | notes: [how it was resolved]`

**Update my part:**
`my part: [update your understanding of your part]`

**Add notes:**
`notes: [additional reflections or insights]`

I'll validate and update your resentment inventory accordingly.
