Analyze patterns in your resentment inventory to identify recurring character defects and triggers.

I'll analyze your resentments and show you:
- Most common character defects (selfish, self-seeking, dishonest, frightened, inconsiderate)
- Most affected life areas (self-esteem, security, ambitions, etc.)
- Common themes in what triggers your resentments
- Progress over time (resolved vs active)
- Patterns in your "my part" descriptions

This analysis helps you:
- Identify character defects to focus on in Step 6 & 7
- Recognize triggers to avoid or handle differently
- See your growth and progress
- Prepare for Step 5 sharing with your sponsor

Just say "analyze resentment patterns"
