List all resentments in your Step 4 inventory.

I'll show you:
- Person/institution you're resentful at
- Brief summary of the cause
- What areas of your life it affects
- Your part (character defects)
- Current status (active/resolved)
- Amends status

You can also filter by:
- `active` - Show only unresolved resentments
- `resolved` - Show only resolved resentments
- `needs-amends` - Show resentments requiring amends
- `recent` - Show resentments added in the last 30 days

Just say "list resentments" or "list resentments [filter]"
