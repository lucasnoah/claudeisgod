Please share:
1. What's ONE specific recovery action you commit to today? (e.g., call sponsor, read pages 86-88, help another alcoholic)
2. Complete this failsafe: "If I struggle today, I will..."

For Tier 2/3 also add:
3. Which character defect will you work on today?
4. Any service commitment for today?

This helps make your recovery commitments specific and achievable.
