Note: The interactive morning routine script requires direct terminal input and cannot be run through Claude Code's bash tool.

To use the morning routine:
1. Open a terminal
2. Run: /home/lucas/projects/my-addiction/tools/commands/morning-routine

Alternatively, I can help you create a morning routine entry by asking you the questions and saving your responses to the log file.
