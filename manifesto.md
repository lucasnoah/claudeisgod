# Manifesto

I am an addict. This repository is a log of my journey and the actions I take as I recover.

## Core Principles

- I will publish tools that will help myself and maybe help others
- I will publish this repo publicly and make updates as I go
- All data about others should be anonymized
- This is a living document - more principles will be added as the journey continues

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A record of progress
- A collection of recovery tools
- A commitment to transparency in recovery
- A resource that might help others on similar paths
